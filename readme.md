Overview
=============

The overall goal is to develop a working synthesisable MIPS-compatible CPU that will interface with the world using a memory-mapped bus, which gives
it access to memory and other peripherals.

Particular focus of this project is to develop a piece of IP which could be 
sold and distributed to many clients, allowing them to integrate the CPU
into any number of products.  This entails producing a production quality CPU with a robust testing process.


Deliverables
=======================

The deliverables consist of the following:

1.  `rtl/mips_cpu_bus.v`: A wrapper that translates the bus-based interface into a modified compatiable Harvard architecture.

2.  `rtl/mips_cpu_harvard_mod.v`: A modified version of the MIPS CPU based on the Harvard   architecture

3.  `test/test_mips_cpu_bus.sh`: A test-bench for any CPU meeting the given interface.
    This will act as a test-bench for your own CPU, but should also aim to check
    whether any other CPU works as well. You can include both scripts, but only the
    one corresponding to your submitted CPU (bus or harvard) will be evaluated.


Instruction Set
===============

The target instruction-set is 32-bit little-endian MIPS1, as defined by
the MIPS ISA Specification (Revision 3.2).

The instructions supported are:

Memory Map
==========

The CPU should not make any explicit assumptions about the location
of instructions, data, or peripherals within the address space. It should
simply execute the instructions it is given, and perform reads and writes
at the addresses implied by the instructions.

There are only two special memory locations:

- `0x00000000` : Attempting to execute address 0 causes the CPU to halt.
- `0xBFC00000` : This is the location at which execution should start after reset.
